# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
In this project we are going to get insights that help a School District Board to make decisions about budget allocations, we are going to analyze how different factors can affect the performance of each high school based on standardized math and reading tests, to do this we will start by cleaning the data, without taking in consideration all the Thomas High School 9th grader's test results. Then we will create different DataFrames to allow us to identify possible correlations between the performances in the tests and the size, type and assigned budget of each school. Our resources are two databases, one of the schools and one of the students in the District.

## Results
* How is the district summary affected?
* How is the school summary affected?
* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
* Math and reading scores by grade
* Scores by school spending
* Scores by school size
* Scores by school type
